This AI was generated using the Neataptic Neural network library.
Over a 24-hour period, several AIs were tested and the best
performing ones were used to generate a new batch, a principle not
dissimilar from Darwin's concept of "Survival of the Fittest".

Included are the source files for the Neataptic library, as well as
a helper script and a batch file used to evaluate each "generation"
of AI.
