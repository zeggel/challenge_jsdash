1. For finding items i use A* algorithm.

2. I build path whole path in memory then apply this to player

3. At the last momet i decide just detect butterfly zones and avoid this, because i didnt have enough time to solve this problem 

4. Before ai add 'lrud' to path it saves copy of screen in array where each cell have a few properties which allow controll their alignment after some changes on the map 

23:56 time is over :(


**Best regards!**
