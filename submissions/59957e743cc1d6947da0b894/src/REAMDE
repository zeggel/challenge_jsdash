In short: (1) kill as many butterflies as possible in 600 seconds; then (2)
collect the diamonds.

1. The player approaches one of the butterflies and hovers above it, constantly
   laying virtual paths into the future and looking for opportunities. If such
   an opportunity presents itself, he drops a loose object on the poor thing
   and goes to the next victim.

2. Once all the butterflies are killed (or the first 600 seconds did run out),
   the player tries to find the longest path which would allow him to score the
   largest streak, and follows the path, collecting the diamonds. The exact
   routes between the pairs of diamonds are selected using the A* pathfinding
   algorithm.

All of this works on top of the bog-standard simulation-inside-simulation.
