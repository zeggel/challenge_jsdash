Deikstra search for diamond collection

Kill butterflies first
butterfly kill predicted by intersecting fall routes with butterfly
routes. 

Maintain graph there nodes is diamonds and edge exist then distance between diamond less then fixed value
Trying not to break connectivity of such graph, but if do go for bigger component

Avoid dropping rocks near dead ends entrances

World simulation for two steps ahead to find out if step
will lead to inevitable death or to butterfly kill


Sometimes character perform random notlethal moves to escape stack situations

After all diamonds collected move almost randomly looking for butterfly kill opportunity
